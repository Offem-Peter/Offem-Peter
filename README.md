- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "debugging" originated from an actual insect? In 1947, when Grace Hopper was working on the Harvard Mark II computer, she and her team found a moth stuck in one of the relays, causing a malfunction. They removed the moth, taped it into the computer's logbook, and noted, "First actual case of bug being found." From that point on, the term "debugging" became synonymous with fixing computer glitches. So, the next time you're tracking down a software bug, you can humorously say you're "debugging" just like Grace Hopper did with a real bug!
